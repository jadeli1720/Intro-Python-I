"""
The Python standard library's 'calendar' module allows you to
render a calendar to your terminal.
https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/calendar.html

Write a program that accepts user input of the form
  `14_cal.py month [year]`
and does the following:
 - If the user doesn't specify any input, your program should
   print the calendar for the current month. The 'datetime'
   module may be helpful for this.
 - If the user specifies one argument, assume they passed in a
   month and render the calendar for that month of the current year.
 - If the user specifies two arguments, assume they passed in
   both the month and the year. Render the calendar for that
   month and year.
 - Otherwise, print a usage statement to the terminal indicating
   the format that your program expects arguments to be given.
   Then exit the program.

# QUESTIONS:
    # 1. Do we use sys to grab current month from system? Why is this imported?
      # so we can add the arguments from the user and do something with them like in the modules.py
    # 2. How do to use calender?
    # 3. How to use datetime?

# Need conditional statement:
    # 1 - No user input --> output current date (datetime)
    # 2 - If user specifies one input --> assume month input and output month of current year
    # 3 - If user put in both inputs --> assume both inputs and output month and year of inputs
    # 4 - Incorrect --> output expected inputs to be given by user 
    # exit program
